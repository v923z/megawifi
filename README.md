========

This project tries to create a link between a web browser and an atmega microcontroller. 
The aim is to have semi-server on the hardware side, and connect to it from a web browser, thereby, 
allowing for control from arbitrary platforms (PC, and android). Since the server cannot be implemented 
completely on the hardware side, a small middleware server is running on either the PC or the android 
device.
